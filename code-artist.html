          <h2>What is Code Art?</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Code art</b>, also known as algorithmic art, is a form of generative art in which images are created with the use of algorithms that have pre-defined criteria. The artist defines what the criteria is, but no on the outcome. The generator is what decides that. This art is not the same as AI generated art. AI generated art is created after the AI is trained on multiple different sample databases, it uses machine learning, while algorithmic art, as the name implies, simply uses algorithms. It features a lot of randomness and geometrical shapes. You'll notice that each time you revisit this page, the color of the code art below will be different. That's because each time you open this page, it is regenerated with a random color thanks to the algorithm. <br>
            <br>
            Algorithmic art isn't limited to just images. Algorithmic compositions are music generated by an algorithm. There are also multiple different types of algorithmic art, that vary in their generation stages. First, <b>cellular automata</b>. Cellular automata consists of a cell grid, in which each cell's state is determined by a set of rules, and the state of its neighbors. Next up is <b>fractal art</b>, which as the name implies consists of fractals. A fractal is a pattern that infinitely repeats in on itself. No matter how much you zoom in on a fractal, you will always end up back at the original pattern. Another one is <b>genetic</b>, or <b>evolutionary art</b>. Art in this form is created in stages, where the end point of each stage is the starting point of the next.
