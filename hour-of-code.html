                  The <a href="https://code.org" target="_blank">Hour Of Code</a> is an international movement, organized by <a href="https://code.org" target="_blank">code.org</a>,
                  meant to increase worldwide interest in coding. As the name implies, an Hour Of Code is an event that takes an hour out of your day to introduce you into the world of coding. It aims to show people that coding isn't magic, and that with a little bit of effort and elbow grease, anyone can learn coding. Anyone can hold an Hour Of Code, and anyone can attend an Hour Of Code. The point is to encourage people of all sorts of people to take a dip into the world of machines.

                  As Team 78, we held our Hour Of Code in Library No. 5 in Turkan. Our audience was the local children of the neighborhood. Kids of all ages gathered into the small library study room to attend our event. Even the library workers paid us a visit at one point. It just goes to show that anyone can attend these events, no matter their age. We had a little bit of technical issues but that's part of the charm these rural areas have, and they were quickly handled as well. We introduced ADA University, before directing the attendees to the <a href="https://studio.code.org/hoc/1">code.org courses</a> we wanted to use.

                Once it was all said and done, we had gone through multiple courses from code.org with the children. They took to it very well, most of them even taking initiative and going farther than we did while teaching them. Overall, the event was a hit. Our listeners didn't even seem that interested in coding before we arrived, yet throughout our hour of code, they each began to get more and more immersed in what we had to say, and quickly made their way through the exercises, understanding each of the different commands that could be used in and the reasons why some blocks were used where they were used.
